abstract: "Dynamic malware analysis is widely regarded as an important tool for
  analysts. However, malware classification research in the dynamic malware
  analysis setting is rare. We have developed a new malware classification
  framework that works specifically in the dynamic analysis setting, namely
  Incremental Malware Classification Framework, or IMCF. IMCF enables partial
  automation on malware classification with high accuracy. "
