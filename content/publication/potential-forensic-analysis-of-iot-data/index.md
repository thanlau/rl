abstract: Academics and practicing digital forensics experts have previously
  proposed several models for tackling the end to end procedure of investigating
  IoT devices. However, these approaches are still very high level or focuses on
  one specific evidence collection technique. There is not, as yet, a
  comprehensive enumeration of classes of forensic data collected by IoT
  devices, nor even a comprehensive list of techniques for extracting specific
  forensic information from specific IoT devices. This paper addresses these
  issues by describing the potential forensic information that can be gathered,
  derived, or inferred from IoT- collected data. We also present an overview of
  existing IoT data collection methods for the Amazon Echo, Z-wave protocol, and
  home routers to illustrate the types of forensic data already being collected
  and the techniques used to obtain it. Finally, we present possible avenues for
  additional mechanisms for obtaining forensic data from these devices.
